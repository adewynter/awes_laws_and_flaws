# Awes, Laws and Flaws From Today's LLM Research


This repository includes everything to reproduce the latest version of the paper [Awes, Laws, and Flaws From Today's LLM Research](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.15409). 

There are a few caveats because of legal/ethical reasons:
1. The data is pseudonymised (no text, author names, or LLM-output reasons), so certain bits of the notebook won't work.
2. There is **no** code to reproduce the data/paper crawling.

Otherwise, raw labels and annotations are here for your data analysing pleasure.
